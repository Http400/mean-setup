            My name is Barbara Chmiel and I’m a professional multi-disciplined graphic designer based in Krakow. I used to work in advertising agencies, but now I am a freelancer. I’ve got experience in creating big campaigns as well as in executing more personal projects. I really appreciate creative cooperation. My biggest passion is print, brand identity and web design. I have a strong sentiment for traditional techniques and DIY. My approach is rather minimal but bold.
            I’m available for freelance work and cooperation. Feel free to contact me.
